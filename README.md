## Objectives

Kubenv was designed to solve a single purpose -- management of a large number of
Kubernetes kubeconfig files while:
* Not having to constantly pass `KUBECONFIG=` environment values
* Avoiding an unwieldly bash_aliases file.
* Constantly remember which alias/kubeconfig you're currently running under.

## Features

* Importing kubeconfig files from anywhere in your filesystem.
* Listing all currently-registered kubeconfig files.
* Easily swapping between registered kubeconfig files.
* Setting custom locations for your registered kubeconfig files.

Planed features:
* Omni-OS compatibility (coming soonâ„¢)
